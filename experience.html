                <p>
                  This project involved the use of Python and AWS to monitor the
                  end-to-end services at clients’ sites and provide data
                  visualisation as well as alerting capabilities when certain
                  metrics were not met. During this project, I was able to
                  develop my Python programming skills such as writing scripts
                  to automate email alerts and pull data in from different
                  sources and persisting it into a database. Further to this, I
                  developed my knowledge in AWS and event driven architecture to
                  get real time data using services such as SNS/SQS and
                  CloudWatch Logs, and then use Lambda functions to retrieve
                  that data. I worked on the UI/UX of the application for
                  visualising data that is easily digestible for stakeholders,
                  and this involved building complex SQL queries. The project
                  also used Agile Methodologies with daily stand up and weekly
                  sprints to consistently meet and exceed the clients’ needs.

                <p>
                  This project aimed at using Java to manipulate a MySQL
                  database with the use of a Back-end application. I used Junit
                  and Mockito for unit testing during the development process
                  for quality assurance and it was useful for the isolation of
                  low-level issues so that my code can run smoothly without
                  errors. This project also involved Jira for implementing agile
                  methodologies such as sprints and Git for version control. The
                  end project is a working inventory-management system capable
                  of tracking and manipulating customer information, orders
                  details and item data.

                >
                <p>
                  This project aimed at combining Backend and Frontend
                  technologies to create a full stack application that has full
                  CRUD functionality. I used Spring Boot and Maven to build the
                  application and used Java Spring Framework to connect to a
                  MySQL database. The Frontend was built using HTML and CSS,
                  setting up the API calls via JavaScript to retrieve the data
                  from my database. For quality assurance, I used Junit and
                  Mockito for both integration and unit testing, Selenium for
                  the user-acceptance testing and SonarQube for static analysis
                  to ensure that my code is as bug-free as possible.
                </p>
                <strong>Group Project – Choonz Full Stack Application</strong>
                <p>
                  This group project aimed to produce a fully functioning Music
                  Library Application called Choonz. The application was to be
                  made in a group which was a great opportunity to implement
                  agile methodologies such as Daily stand-ups and be able to
                  understand its benefits for the development of applications.
                  My role was to assist in building some of the Backend as well
                  as contributing to some of the implementation of the Frontend.
                  I also had a role in contributing towards testing in the form
                  of integration testing, user acceptance testing and
                  non-functional testing. This project allowed me to use many
                  different testing technologies such as JMeter, Cucumber and
                  Gherkin as well as to improve upon the use of Junit and
                  Mockito. The final product was a fully functioning Music
                  Library Web Application that meets industry standard
                  requirements for testing.
