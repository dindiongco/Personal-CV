    <h3>Profile</h3>
    <p>
      My interest in the IT industry started mainly during my Economics course
      at university. I was part of many group projects where I was always
      learning about new technologies. I had to use software-based systems such
      as MATLAB and STATA MP to complete my assignments. With Economics being an
      analytical and data focused degree, I was able to practice these skills
      and further improve upon them. My experience at university has helped me
      realise that I enjoy working with the software aspect of technology and I
      look forward to building upon my programming knowledge.

    <h3>Work Experience</h3>
    <h4>QA Consulting - Consultant (06/2021 - 11/2021)</h4>
    <strong>Individual Project – Inventory Management System [Week 6]</strong>
    <p>
      This project aimed at using Java to manipulate a MySQL database with the
      use of a Back-end application. I used Junit and Mockito for unit testing
      during the development process for quality assurance and it was useful for
      the isolation of low-level issues so that my code can run smoothly without
      errors. This project also involved Jira for implementing agile
      methodologies such as sprints and Git for version control. The end project
      is a working inventory-management system capable of tracking and
      manipulating customer information, orders details and item data.
    </p>
    <strong>Individual Project – To Do Full Stack Application [Week 9]</strong>
    <p>
      This project aimed at combining Backend and Frontend technologies to
      create a full stack application that has full CRUD functionality. I used
      Spring Boot and Maven to build the application and used Java Spring
      Framework to connect to a MySQL database. The Frontend was built using
      HTML and CSS, setting up the API calls via JavaScript to retrieve the data
      from my database. For quality assurance, I used Junit and Mockito for both
      integration and unit testing, Selenium for the user-acceptance testing and
      SonarQube for static analysis to ensure that my code is as bug-free as
      possible.
    </p>
    <strong>Group Project – Choonz Full Stack Application [Week 12] </strong>
    <p>
      This group project aimed to produce a fully functioning Music Library
      Application called Choonz. The application was to be made in a group which
      was a great opportunity to implement agile methodologies such as Daily
      stand-ups and be able to understand its benefits for the development of
      applications. My role was to assist in building some of the Backend as
      well as contributing to some of the implementation of the Frontend. I also
      had a role in contributing towards testing in the form of integration
      testing, user acceptance testing and non-functional testing. This project
      allowed me to use many different testing technologies such as JMeter,
      Cucumber and Gherkin as well as to improve upon the use of Junit and
      Mockito. The final product was a fully functioning Music Library Web
      Application that meets industry standard requirements for testing.

    <h4>Infosys Ltd – Technology Associate</h4>
    <p>
      Progressing through my stream training, I further developed my knowledge
      in key Spring and Spring Boot development modules. Some of the topics that
      we covered include Spring Data and using the Rest API in Spring to
      communicate to other applications. Furthermore, I am comfortable in
      developing a complete backend with a functional database (MySQL). In
      addition to this, I have completed my training in Angular and am able to
      create a functional frontend with modules such as using Reactive forms
      with validation for Users to add their details. Using Angular and Spring
      boot, I have knowledge in developing a full stack application that
      connects a singlepage application in Angular to a backend in Spring Boot
      that connects to a Database in MySQL.
    </p>
    <strong>BP (Client) - Developer</strong>
    <p>
      For my first client project, I was assigned to be a Developer for BP. The
      project I was assigned to used AWS Services to connect to other BP Teams'
      endpoints and display their data visually. On top of this, we handled
      error alerting to the teams when specific metrics were not met. This
      project involved using Azure DevOps to maintain Agile Practices. This
      project has allowed me to improve and develop my ability to use different
      technologies and improved upon them.
      <ul>Technologies used:
        <li>SQL</li>
        <li>Python</li>
        <li>AWS Services such as Lambda, SQS, SNS, Kinesis Data Streams</li>
        <li>ADO and Git for DevOps</li>
        <li>Infosys Propriety Platform for UI/UX development of data dashboards</li>
      </ul>
